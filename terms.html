                <h4>Governing law, jurisdiction and dispute resolution:</h4>
                <p>All disputes in relation to the Website and these Terms shall be governed by the laws of India,
                    without having regard to conflict of laws, and the courts at Mumbai shall have exclusive
                    jurisdiction to adjudicate all disputes.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the above, disputes and claims shall be settled by arbitration to be conducted in
                    accordance with the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, by a sole arbitrator to be
                    appointed by RIL. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in the English language and the
                    venue of arbitration shall be Mumbai. The arbitrator shall decide any such dispute or claim strictly
                    in accordance with the governing law. Judgment upon any arbitral award rendered hereunder may be
                    entered in any court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for a judicial
                    acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. The costs and expenses of
                    the arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by each party to the

                <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained anywhere in these Terms, you agree that monetary

                    the Terms of this Website and accordingly, RIL shall be entitled to seek an injunction, restraining
                    order, right for recovery, suit for specific performance or such other equitable relief as a court
                    of competent jurisdiction may deem necessary or appropriate to restrain you from committing any
