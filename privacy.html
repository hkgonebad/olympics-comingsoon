                        to improve
                        the way our Website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking

                <p>We may disclose your Personal Information to the following types of third parties:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vendors and contractors who are performing services on our behalf to enable uses of the
                        information we have

                    <li>Our group companies.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We may also need to disclose your Personal Information in the following circumstances:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If we are required to do so by law or pursuant to a regulatory request;</li>
                    <li>In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets we may be required to disclose certain
                        of your

                    <li>In order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements or in respect of other legal
                        claims.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We do not sell any Personal Information of Users. We may provide aggregated and anonymised
                    information to our
                    sponsors and partners but this does not include Personal Information and you will not be
                    identifiable. We may
                    provide additional Personal Information to our sponsors and partners where you have consented to
                    that sharing.
                </p>
                <p>When we use third parties to assist us in processing your Personal Information, we require that they
                    comply with
                    our Privacy Policy, applicable privacy laws and any other appropriate confidentiality and security
                    measures.</p>
                <p>If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information, we may transfer that Personal Information
                    from your
                    country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. Your Personal
                    Information may be
                    collected and stored on servers located in the territory of India and such other countries as we may
                    disclose
                    from time to time. If we transfer your Personal Information to another country, we will ensure a
                    similar degree
                    of protection is afforded to it by ensuring that appropriate safeguards are implemented, to the
                    extent required
                    by the applicable privacy laws. Please contact us using the details set out below if you want
                    further
                    information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Information.</p>

                <h4>CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY</h4>
                <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us,
                    both during
                    transmission and, once we receive it, for storage and disposal. When you enter Personal Information
                    on our
                    registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
                    All
                    information we gather is securely stored within databases controlled by us. The databases are stored
                    on servers
                    secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited.</p>
                <p>However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%
                    secure. Therefore,
                    while we strive to use generally acceptable industry means to protect your Personal Information, we
                    cannot
                    guarantee its absolute security.</p>
                <p>We limit access to Personal Information to employees/personnel who we believe reasonably need to come
                    into
                    contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
                </p>
                <p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access to your
                    User Profile or
                    the Rewards Program on our Website or other products and services, you are responsible for keeping
                    this password
                    confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>

                <h4>THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES</h4>
                <p>This Privacy Policy only applies to our Website. If you click on a link to a third party site or
                    otherwise leave
                    the Website you will go to a website that is outside our control. Because we cannot control the
                    activities of
                    third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your Personal Information by such
                    third parties,
                    and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as we do.
                    We encourage
                    you to review the privacy policies of any other website and/or service provider from whom you
                    request services.
                    If you visit a third party website that is linked to our Website, you should consult that website’s
                    privacy
                    policy before providing any Personal Information.</p>

                <h4>HOW LONG WILL WE KEEP YOUR DATA?</h4>
                <p>We will keep your data for as long as required in connection with the original purpose for which that
                    data was
                    collected (e.g. where you are still happy to hear from us about our latest news and services).</p>
                <p>Once you no longer wish to be engaged with us we may still need to keep hold of your data if there is
                    a legal
                    reason for doing so (e.g. for tax purposes or where we are resolving a dispute with you), but we
                    will only
                    retain the data which is strictly necessary for such reason and thereafter, will remove this data
                    from our
                    systems.</p>

                <h4>YOUR RIGHTS</h4>
                <p>We will provide you with the rights granted to you under applicable privacy laws, but these rights
                    may differ
                    depending on where you are.</p>
                <p>For example, if you are in the United Kingdom or the European Economic Area, you may be entitled to
                    various
                    rights under the applicable privacy laws which entitle you, in certain circumstances, to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ask us for a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you;</li>
                    <li>Correct or update your Personal Information, which you can do yourself by logging into your
                        account (if
                        relevant) or if you would prefer, please contact us and we can assist;</li>
                    <li>Request that we delete your Personal Information;</li>
                    <li>Object to the handling of your Personal Information where we are relying on a legitimate
                        interest (as set
                        out in the above table);</li>
                    <li>Restrict the processing of your Personal Information;</li>
                    <li>Request the transfer of your Personal Information (or some of it) to a third party service
                        provider; or</li>
                    <li>Where you have provided your consent for something, in certain circumstances, you may withdraw
                        this consent
                        (but note that we may continue to use your Personal Information if we have legal grounds for
                        doing so).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you are in Australia, you can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ask us for a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you;</li>
                    <li>Correct or update your Personal Information, which you can do yourself by logging into your
                        account (if
                        relevant) or if you would prefer, please contact us and we can assist.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Australian Privacy Principles set out the circumstances when we can refuse those requests. If we
                    do refuse
                    your request, we will provide you with a written notice that sets out the reasons (unless it would
                    be
                    unreasonable to provide them to you). Subject to our right to refuse access, we will provide you
                    with a report
                    that lists any Personal Information that we may hold about you.</p>
                <p>If you live in California, you may also be entitled to rights to access specific types of Personal
                    Information,
                    to request its deletion, and not to be denied goods or services for exercising these rights.</p>
                <p>All Users have the right to correction of inaccurate data.</p>
                <p>Please contact us if you would like to exercise your rights, which most of the time you can do for
                    free. In some
                    circumstances, applicable privacy laws allow us to charge a fee or to refuse your request. If we
                    wish to charge
                    a fee, or refuse your request, we will inform you in writing and set out the reasons. Otherwise, we
                    will always
                    respond within one month (unless there is a legal reason for us to take longer).</p>
                <p>If it is not clear to us who is making the request, we may ask you to confirm your identity before we
                    proceed.
                </p>
                <p>You may also contact the data protection authority where you live if you have any concerns about the
                    way we are
                    handling your Personal Information. However, where possible, please speak to us first as we would
                    appreciate the
                    opportunity to help with your concern.</p>
